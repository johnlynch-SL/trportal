*Error baking table*

1. I created a CakePHP app, `trportal`.

2. I created `trdb`, a database of two tables (`users` and `results`) with the below SQL:
```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    admin TINYINT(1) UNSIGNED DEFAULT 0,
    password VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    status TINYINT(1) UNSIGNED DEFAULT 1,
    created_by INT(11) UNSIGNED,
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id),
    created_on DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE results (
    job_processing_id INT(11) UNSIGNED,
    test_type_id INT(5) UNSIGNED,
    test_counter INT(5) UNSIGNED,
    number VARCHAR(20),
    country VARCHAR(100),
    start_time DATETIME,
    end_time DATETIME,
    connect_time DATETIME,
    score FLOAT(5, 2) UNSIGNED,
    url VARCHAR(1024),
    added_by INT(11) UNSIGNED,
    added_on DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (added_by) REFERENCES users(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (job_processing_id, test_type_id, test_counter)
);
```

3. I edited `config/app.php` with database access credentials.

4. I checked the default landing page and got all 9 green chef's hats.

5. I ran `./bin/cake bake all users` successfully. All user actions perform as expected.

6. I ran `./bin/cake bake all, with the following result:

```
$ ./bin/cake bake all results
Bake All

7. I noted the warning, `<warning>Bake cannot generate associations for composite primary keys at this time</warning>.`

8. I pointed the browser at `http://127.0.0.1/trportal/results` and was served an error page, attached, with the message
`SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'trdb.job_processings' doesn't exist`.

9. If I look in my `ResultsController`, I find the `index()` method has 

`$this->paginate = ['contain' => ['JobProcessings', 'TestTypes'],];`.

Also in the `add()` and `edit()` methods these spurious fields are referred to, e.g.:

`$this->set(compact('result', 'jobProcessings', 'testTypes'));`

I This makes me think bake is misinterpreting something, as these are inflexions of just parts of the key names in the primary key:
`PRIMARY KEY (job_processing_id, test_type_id, test_counter)`

-----------------------------------------

My questions are:
1. Is this error caused by `bake`'s inability to deal with composite primary keys?
2. What would be the best way to overcome it?  Abandon the composite primary key and rebake, then add back the key later, or just set up my functionality manually?
