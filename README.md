# Test Results Portal

## Overview

The specification describes a Web Portal for viewing call test results.

A user will have the ability to login to the portal and find the results they need using standard features like search, sort and filters. Also, users will have the ability to import new results through the portal and also export test results that already exist.

There will be an admin user role which can manage user accounts, creating/editing/deleting them as they see fit.
